# BlockCryptoLabLabsPro

## Description

A Rust-based cryptocurrency library implementing zk-SNARKs for privacy-preserving transactions and leveraging BLS signatures for efficient threshold cryptography in distributed key generation.

## Features

- Integrate a hardware security module (HSM) for secure key storage and management.
- Implement a distributed ledger technology (DLT) with Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus.
- Utilize zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable privacy-preserving transactions.
- Develop a RESTful API for seamless integration with external applications and services.
- Establish a secure and scalable peer-to-peer (P2P) network architecture.
- Employ advanced encryption standards (AES-256) for data protection at rest and in transit.
- Create a comprehensive audit trail using immutable logs for regulatory compliance.
- Build a decentralized identity management system based on verifiable credentials.
